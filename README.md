# Estimating gender and race on Twitter

[Who Do You Follow?](http://whoyoufollow.io) is a tool for assessing the gender, racial, and intersectional breakdown of the people you follow on Twitter. Its goal is to help people understand which perspectives theyâ€™ve surrounded themselves with on the platform, and to motivate them to diversify the voices they seek out going forward.

Because algorithms are far from ideal in these contexts, this tool supplements common name-based gender/race estimates with relevant information drawn directly from Twitter bios (e.g., he/him or #BlackinSTEM). It also gives you the option to improve the automatic estimates by manually entering demographic information for a sample of the people you follow. Algorithmic, bio-based, and second-hand assessments of individuals' gender and race can all be highly flawed and are likely to be wrong in many cases, but in our opinion it is better than not making an effort at all.
